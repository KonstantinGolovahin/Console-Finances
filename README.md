## Description
 
This website was created for boot camp as a challange 4 for WC 11/12/2022. It is required to create a code for analyzing some financial records of a company. Please see below a list of requirements to match.

## Grading Requirements

This homework is graded based on the following criteria: 

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 25
  Total: $2561231

  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
